  <h1>Understanding the 1.8% Reservation System in Treasure NFT – A Beginner’s Guide 🚀</h1>
  <p>NFT investments are evolving, and Treasure NFT brings a unique approach with its 1.8% daily reservation system. But what does this mean, and how can you maximize your earnings? If you're new to Treasure NFT, this guide will break down everything in simple terms so you can start investing with confidence! 💰</p>

  <h2>What is the 1.8% Reservation System? 🤔</h2>
  <p>The reservation system in Treasure NFT is a compounded daily interest system where investors earn 1.8% daily on their reserved funds. This means your investment grows exponentially over time, thanks to the power of compounding interest.</p>

  <h3>How It Works:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ You deposit funds into the reservation system</li>
    <li>✅ Every day, your balance grows by 1.8% (compounded)</li>
    <li>✅ Over time, your earnings increase faster and faster</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p>🚀 Example:<br>
    If you start with $100, your balance will grow like this:</p>
    <p>Day 1: $100 → $101.80<br>
    Day 2: $101.80 → $103.64<br>
    Day 3: $103.64 → $105.51<br>
    Day 30: You'll have $157.31 – 57% growth in just a month!<br>
    This is the power of compound interest – the more time you give your money, the more it grows!</p>
  </div>

  <h2>How to Get Started with Treasure NFT's 1.8% System?</h2>
  
  <h3>Step 1: Claim Your $150 Promo Balance 🎁</h3>
  <p>New users get $150 FREE for 3 days. This balance vanishes if not used, so make sure to add funds and grow it!</p>
  <div class="cta">
    ➡️ Use Refer Code: <strong>U5WFQ0XW</strong> to activate your $150 bonus! 🎉
  </div>

  <h3>Step 2: Choose Your Investment Amount 💵</h3>
  <p>You can invest $0, $100, $150, $200, or $300 in addition to the promo balance. The more you invest, the more you earn!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ If you invest $100, you start with $250 ($150 promo + $100)</li>
    <li>✅ Your 1.8% compounded interest applies to the entire amount!</li>
    <li>✅ If no extra investment is made, the promo balance disappears after 3 days, and only your deposited amount continues growing</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 3: Watch Your Balance Grow 📈</h3>
  <p>The Treasure NFT Calculator helps you track your daily earnings for up to 180 days. You can see how your funds increase over time, helping you make smarter investment decisions.</p>

  <h2>How Does the 1.8% System Work with NFT Stacking?</h2>
  <p>Treasure NFT has two earning systems:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Reservation System (1.8%) – Applies to your deposited funds daily</li>
    <li>NFT Stacking Zones (1.2% – 1.7%) – Special investment zones with higher returns</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="feature">
    <p>🔹 Auto-Transition Feature:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When your reservation balance reaches $200, it moves to Free Zone 1 (1.2%)</li>
      <li>When it hits $500, it upgrades to Free Zone 2 (1.5%)</li>
      <li>At $800, it enters Free Zone 3 (1.7%)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="warning">
    <p>🛑 Important: On the third day of stacking, both stacking interest + reservation interest (1.8%) are applied before unlocking funds.</p>
    <p>📌 Formula for the 3rd Day of Stacking:<br>
    👉 New Balance = Previous Balance × (1 + Stacking Interest) × (1 + Reservation Interest)</p>
    <p>💡 This means bigger profits over time!</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why Is This System So Powerful?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Compounded Daily Growth – Your earnings increase exponentially over time</li>
    <li>✅ Auto-Upgrades – Higher investment amounts move into more profitable zones</li>
    <li>✅ Risk-Free Promo Balance – Start with $150 free to see how it works</li>
    <li>✅ Long-Term Wealth Building – The system helps you reinvest and grow continuously</li>
  </ul>
  <p>💰 A small deposit today can turn into huge earnings over time!</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts: Should You Use the 1.8% Reservation System?</h2>
  <p>💎 If you're looking for a smart way to grow your NFT investment, Treasure NFT's 1.8% daily compounding system is a game-changer. It allows you to start small and watch your funds multiply over time.</p>
