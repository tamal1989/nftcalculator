                    <li><b>Reservation System</b> – Users invest in a pool where their funds grow at a fixed 1.8% daily interest rate for a limited period.</li>

            </div>

            <h2>Is Treasure NFT Legal?</h2>
			<p>The legality of Treasure NFT depends on multiple factors:</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>✅ Regulatory Compliance</h3>
			<p>Treasure NFT operates as a decentralized platform, meaning it does not rely on traditional financial institutions. This gives it more flexibility but also raises concerns about whether it is regulated. However, since NFTs are legally recognized as digital assets in many countries, the platform itself does not violate any major financial regulations.</p>
			<h3>✅ Transparency & Smart Contracts</h3>
			<p>One of the key aspects of trustworthy NFT platforms is the use of smart contracts. Treasure NFT operates on a verified blockchain network, ensuring that transactions are transparent, automated, and secure.</p>
			<h3>✅ User Protection & Security</h3>
			<p>Treasure NFT uses secure encryption and blockchain verification to protect user investments. Since all transactions occur on-chain, it is nearly impossible for unauthorized changes or fraudulent activities to happen without being detected.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Is Treasure NFT a Scam? Key Questions to Consider</h2>
			<p>Despite its promising features, some skeptics question whether Treasure NFT is a Ponzi scheme or a legitimate investment. Let’s address these concerns:</p>
			
            <div class="highlight">
           <p><h3>❓ How are the high returns sustainable? </h3></p>
		   <p>Treasure NFT generates revenue through NFT staking and trading fees, allowing it to offer attractive returns. However, high-yield investments always carry risks, and users should be aware that market conditions can affect earnings.</p>
		   
		   <p><h3>❓ Is there a risk of funds disappearing?</h3></p>
		   <p>Unlike scam projects that operate without transparency, Treasure NFT provides real-time tracking of investments and growth, ensuring that users always know where their funds are.</p>
		   <p><h3>❓ What happens if the platform shuts down?</h3></p>
		   <p>Because the platform is built on blockchain technology, users' funds and transactions remain on-chain. Even if the website goes offline, the smart contracts continue to operate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verdict-box">
                <h2>Why Treasure NFT Can Be Trusted?</h2>
